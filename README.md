# Beast

Beast is a free media server software that allows you to stream your local media library to all of your devices and friends.
It organizes movie and television content and adds posters, plot summaries, cast and crew lists, technical details, critical reviews, and subtitles.
Beast is also capable of transcoding files if the codec is incompatible with the device playing the media.
It can run on any linux system and supports docker.

# Prerequisites

You need to already have a media library managed by Sonarr or Radarr. 
This is required to index the library and load the required metadatas as Beast will curently not index the library by itself.
